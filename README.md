# Creating Anime Characters using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and Keras

Welcome to the **Creating Anime Characters using DCGANs and Keras** repository! This project is a mentee assignment from the IBM Advanced AI program, building upon the completion of the "Build a Chatbot to Analyze PDF Document Using LLM" course from CognitiveClass.ai. In this project, we dive into generating anime characters using Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs) and the Keras library. DCGANs are a powerful AI model, ideal for creating synthetic images.
